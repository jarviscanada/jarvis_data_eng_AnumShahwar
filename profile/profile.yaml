I am a recent Business Technology Management graduate from Toronto Metropolitan University with a minor in Finance. Throughout my undergraduate program, I gained hands on experience and refined my skills in key areas such as SQL, BPMN, UML, business, and system requirements. Using the experience and knowledge I gained, I contributed it towards a capstone project that I had completed with a client from CIBC. In addition, I completed a four-month internship as a Business Analyst at CIBC where I applied my analytical and problem-solving skills to support various product development and change management initiatives. I have a passion for business and systems analyst, and I am seeking opportunities for Business System Analyst roles.

# Jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App"
    git_url: "/linux_sql" 
    description: Jarvis has a Linux Cluster Administrative team (LCA). The LCA team needs to be able to get the hardware specifications so they can monitor each node. There were multiple technologies used to meet the project requirements such as PSQL, Docker, Git and Bash. This project consisted of a product for the LCA so that they can meet their business requirements. To ensure the LCA team was able to do this, the project was designed to collect the data into its RDBMS. This would help ensure that the LCA team will have access to the data and can use the data provided to create reports based on business needs.
